# How To Use?
First, locate your save file. It is always located in `Sheltered\saves\savedata_0n.dat`, n is a number. After you locate your save, you must back-up your file. Because it might break your save sometimes. Then, open the editor and upload your save file. It will show you a table. You can edit item counts, player metas and world settings. When you finish editing, you must press  "Save Changes" button and download file, then you must rename it no `savedata_0n.dat` and put it back into saves folder and that's it!

If you want to edit manually, you must upload file and download it. After you download, edit with `Notepad++.` `DO NOT USE NOTEPAD!` Notepad breaks the coding of file but `Notepad++` doesn't. When you finish editing by hand, you re-upload your edited file and download it, put it back into saves folder and that's it!
